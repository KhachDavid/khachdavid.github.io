# EL Tracker: The better transit tracker

Since January 2023, I have been a daily rider of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority). When trying to track train arrival times, I got irriated by the lack of a simple transit app. One day I was asked, "Why can't I have a widget that shows me when the train is coming?"

And thus, EL Tracker was born. From there the idea only grew. I conducted conversations with users and integrated their feedback into the app. For example, a beta tester was having an issue with CTA’s official elevator outage alerts. The only way they would know the elevator is out, was to sign up for text alerts. The CTA would send them alerts for all the elevators across the entire system, which is like 400 elevators. They break all the time. You would be surprised at the frequency.

Nothing felt better than hearing our beta tester say, "You solved my problem". With EL Tracker you can sign up for notifications to know about delays and major outages for your favorite lines and specific stations.
