# Simulating Scallop Eyes

A bioinspired simulation exploring how scallops use their eyes to detect and escape from threats. This project demonstrates the intersection of biology and engineering.

## Features
- Models scallop vision to simulate threat detection.
- Explores the applications of biomimicry in engineering designs.
- Developed using **Three.js** and **Computer Vision** techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Libraries:** Three.js
- **Concepts:** Biomimicry, Simulation, Computer Vision
